Mapping design into LUTs...
Writing file project.ngm...
Running directed packing...
ERROR:Pack:2811 - Directed packing was unable to obey the user design
   constraints (LOC=T6) which requires the combination of the symbols listed
   below to be packed into a single IOB33 component.

   The directed pack was not possible because: More than one pad symbol.
   The symbols involved are:
   	PAD symbol "dout<0>" (Pad Signal = dout<0>)
   	BUF symbol "dout<0>_OBUF" (Output Signal = dout<0>)
   	PAD symbol "done.PAD" (Pad Signal = done)

Mapping completed.
See MAP report file "project.mrp" for details.
Problem encountered during the packing phase.
