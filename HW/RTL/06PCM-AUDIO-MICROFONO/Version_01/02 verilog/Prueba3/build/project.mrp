Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   1
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2811 - Directed packing was unable to obey the user design
   constraints (LOC=T6) which requires the combination of the symbols listed
   below to be packed into a single IOB33 component.

   The directed pack was not possible because: More than one pad symbol.
   The symbols involved are:
   	PAD symbol "dout<0>" (Pad Signal = dout<0>)
   	BUF symbol "dout<0>_OBUF" (Output Signal = dout<0>)
   	PAD symbol "done.PAD" (Pad Signal = done)

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network micData_IBUF has no load.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
