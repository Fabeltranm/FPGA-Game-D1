<msg type="error" file="Pack" num="2811" delta="new" >Directed packing was unable to obey the user design constraints <arg fmt="%z" index="1">(LOC=T6) which requires the combination of the symbols listed below to be packed into a single IOB33 component.

The directed pack was not possible because: More than one pad symbol.
The symbols involved are:
	PAD symbol &quot;dout&lt;0&gt;&quot; (Pad Signal = dout&lt;0&gt;)
	BUF symbol &quot;dout&lt;0&gt;_OBUF&quot; (Output Signal = dout&lt;0&gt;)
	PAD symbol &quot;done.PAD&quot; (Pad Signal = done)</arg>
